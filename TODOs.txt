* Switch to size_t instead of int when applicable.
* Figure out if ArrayDeque needs realloc or malloc for storage resizing.
* Switch from malloc to calloc?
  - Slower but will prevent getting non-0 values at the begining.
* Change ArrayDeque storage to be last field so I can do single allocation?
* Switch from int to uintx_t from stdint.h?
* Make a no pointer/malloc version of data structures.
  - Either stack based or using handles (IDs).
* Adopt IWYU.

* Who is reponsible for freeing elements stored in ArrayDeque?
* Code all these allocators:

* Re-structure Makefiles to allow for caching.
